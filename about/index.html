			<p>I like programming. I went to KV for my school studies, I'm now at ACET, studying CS there. Earlier,  I've made a dozen of small projects in my field including some programs and websites. Apart from QWERTY, I also use ASET layout. I live in Aligarh, UP. In my free time, I love to read novels.</p>
